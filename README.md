# coriolis
A roller bot for Coriolis

This program is developed with Discord.js. A Node.js library. It is for the use of people who are running Coriolis games over discord and other online gaming applications.
In future builds I intend to add webfacing components. 

Each .js file in the command folder is a command triggered by typing c:<command> <arg>. 

The development server can be found at https://discord.gg/kakwwzG

This readme will be added to and reformated in the coming weeks.
